Gravity offers one Long Term Support (LTS) release for every 2nd Kubernetes
minor version, allowing for seamless upgrades per Kubernetes
[supported version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-version-skew).
LTS Gravity versions are supported with security and bug fixes for two years
after the x.x.0 release date.

Non-LTS (regular) versions of Gravity have the latest features and offer
more current versions of Kubernetes. Regular versions of Gravity are supported
with security and bug fixes until the subsequent Gravity release is published.

## Unsupported Releases

These releases are past their End of Life date, and no longer receive security
and bug fixes. [Gravity customers](https://gravitational.com/gravity/demo/) can
extend updates past EOL through customer agreements if required.

## 4.x Releases

### Instructions on upgrading to 4.23.0+

Upgrading clusters to Gravity 4.23.0 works via the command line interface (CLI) only.
To upgrade a cluster with an application packaged with the Gravity 4.23+
follow the procedure below.

First, the application must be published into the Ops Center. This allows
all connected clusters to see that a new version is available.

On a cluster side, download the new update by logging into one of the cluster nodes and
executing the command below:

```bash
$ gravity update download
```

The next step is to download the latest version of the `gravity` binary.
For example, if upgrading to 4.26.0:

```bash
$ curl https://get.gravitational.io/telekube/bin/4.26.0/linux/x86_64/gravity -o /tmp/gravity
$ chmod +x /tmp/gravity
```

Finally, launch the update process:

```bash
$ /tmp/gravity upgrade
```

This will upgrade the cluster and the system instance of the `gravity` binary,
so the temporary copy in `/tmp` can be discarded.
